Example of ConboJS integration with Phaser 3
============================================

As well as being a great way to create applications in its own right, the power of ConboJS can easily be harnessed to add models, controllers and services to view-only frameworks, like the excellent Phaser HTML5 game framework.

This example shows how you can leverage ConboJS features, including models, dependency injection and auto instantiation, to give structure to your Phaser 3 games and connect them to web services and other data sources.

Quick start
-----------

1. Install TypeScript globally using `npm i -g typescript`
1. Install project dependencies using `npm i`
1. Build the project using `npm run serve` or open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and press `Control-Shift-B`
1. Open http://localhost:8086/index.html in your browser
